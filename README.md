This is a small Twitter application, written in Common Lisp, that
takes longform text (with optional media references) and slices it
up into numbered tweets, threads them, and spaces them out to
emulate typists of varying speeds.

For this to work, you need to get [chirp][chirp] spun up with a
custom application, and authenticated to the Twitter account you
want to send tweets as.
